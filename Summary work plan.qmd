## Plan - what do I need to do and status of each

## Start as a GitHub project?

-   Explore GitHub and make it workupdate.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)

## Overarching structure

-   work out headline model and create different files which will hold the engines. Rest of tasks are based on what was used last time.

## Get data

-   Scrape from FPL API

-   Find data of results by team

-   Other team or player data?

-   Get Opta projections

## Predict the scores of matches based on the teams involved

-   Import historic team score data

-   Create a model for projecting the scores of future fixtures - poisson attack vs defence scores + home advantage + exponential time weighting backoff

## Predict player scores

-   Import player data

-   Model different kinds of player scores:

    -   Goalkeeper

    -   Defender

    -   Midfielder

    -   Striker

-   Prediction for each player score for future games

## Pick a team

-   Create and model algorithm for picking players to make up a 15

## Add other features of the game

-   Injuries

-   Transfers

-   Chips

-   Newly promoted teams

-   New players

-   Bonus points

-   Yellow cards

## Refining and modelling

-   Create season emulator for projecting the performance of different models across the season / for predicting the next gameweek

-   Think of different options for model - both in individual elements and in overarching structure

-   Try out different algorithms for each part of the model and evaluate them

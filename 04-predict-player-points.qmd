## Predict player scores

-   Set up required libraries and import csvs - requires running of both get-data and predict-scores

```{r}
#| label: set-up
#| include: false

#Set up libraries required in addition to what is in get data

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

# Import required data

predict_future_rows <- read_csv("processed_data/predict_future_rows.csv")
fpl_elements <- read_csv("processed_data/fpl_elements.csv")
```

-   

-   Format player data - use FPL API data as a base

-   Bring in goals scored stats from worldfootballR

-   And matches played in stats from the same source

-   Create an estimate of proportion of goals scored, and proportion of games played in for each player in each team

-   Model different kinds of player scores by role:

    -   Goalkeeper - played + clean sheets

    -   Defender - played + clean sheets + goals + assists

    -   Midfielder - played + clean sheets + goals + assists

    -   Striker - played + goals + assists

-   Prediction for each player score for upcoming games, including an exponential backoff weighting.

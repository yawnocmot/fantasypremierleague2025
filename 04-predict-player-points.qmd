## Predict player scores

-   Set up required libraries and import csvs - requires running of both get-data and predict-scores

```{r}
#| label: set-up
#| include: false

#Set up libraries required in addition to what is in get data

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

# Import required data

predict_future_rows <- read_csv("processed_data/predict_future_rows.csv")
fpl_elements <- read_csv("processed_data/fpl_elements.csv")
```

-   Format player data - for now just use from FPL API

-   Model different kinds of player scores:

    -   Goalkeeper

    -   Defender

    -   Midfielder

    -   Striker

-   Prediction for each player score for future games

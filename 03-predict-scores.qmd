## Predict the scores of matches based on the teams involved

-   Set up what libraries are needed, and name the precursors

-   Set up a file with well coded data for team fixtures and scores

-   Set up a poisson model based on each team having an attack score and a defence score

-   Plus home advantage

-   Plus changes over time

-   Create some visuals for demonstrating teams' ability and how it changes over time.
